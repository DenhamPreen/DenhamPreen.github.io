      <p class="section-description">There are two ways to impact employment, either job creation through an open market platform like that of uber or upskill people. This comes down to a prevalent issue of access to education. How do you improve access to education? With technology as its ability to scale at no additional cost. Online facilities are underutilised. Therefore, how can we make current education more accessible? By making it more affordable. A popular opinion is that the government has the ability to fund free education but is unable because funds are misallocated. This app is a platform that allows people to donate micro payments towards paying for individuals education. A platform that links students to funders, where the key is that a funder can fund small amounts less than R5.</p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">Why?</h3>
      <p class="section-description">Education is the foundation of development. Education is too expensive in South Africa. Its reserved for the wealthy and intrinsically discriminatory. The wealthy get wealthier and the poor get poorer. Why is education not affordable? is it because the government cant afford to build a foundation for the future? Or is it because the government is "misallocating" those funds away from a prosperous future?</p>

        <p><small>The prototype on the opening window is an imperfected quick concept mock up</small></p>
      <p>The intention of this website is to advertise the application to the target audience. I may be diverging from the scope of how to address unemployment although I hope I haven't misinterpreted the guidelines. I would like to emphasize my logic, being: <br>
          To address unemployment, in a South African context, would be to improve <span class="tooltip">skill/education<span class="tooltiptext">I use skill and education synonymously throughout this website</span></span> and the most effective approach to this would be to improve the access to current education. 
        </p><br>
        <h4>The Target Audiences</h4>
        
        <p>Primary: People who want to fund education, through allocating their tax expenditure<span class="tooltip">registered<span class="tooltiptext">Unaware of the challenges associated here</span></span> charities.</p>
        <p>Secondary: People who want to fund education, who are altruistic by nature.</p>
        <p>Tertiary: Businesses that value corporate social responsibility or more so having a favourable business image</p>
        <p><small>*I disregard students in need of funding as a target audience, I believe there are plenty of those</small></p>
